Problem Statement: Currently, providing a full kwxsync command (with all projects) to the Klocwork server causes it to crash.
Desired Solution: We want a script that takes a full kwxsync command and is capable of splitting it up into several equivalent kwxsync commands.

Example input:
kwxsync --statuses "Analyze","Ignore","Not a problem","Fix","Fix in Next Release","Defer","Filter" --last-sync "05-03-2016 00:00:00" --host ***REMOVED*** --port 8080 ***REMOVED***

Desired output:
A set of calls to kwxsync, either with projects in pairs (i.e. two projects per kwxsync command) or some other number (perhaps 10?). If we had a setting where we could set the number of projects per kwxsync command that would be so lit bruv.
The important things is that every project must be sync'd with every other project.
e.g. if we have projects A, B, C and D, the correct output (assuming tuples) would be:
kwxsync A B
kwxsync A C
kwxsync A D
kwxsync B C
kwxsync B D
kwxsync C D
